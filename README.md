## About

<!-- <img src='./src/assets/app.PNG' alt='screenshot' width="600"> -->

To-do list (created using React.js) - Since I hadn't created a to-do list since bootcamp, I decided to create my own from scratch using React.js and MDBootstrap modified to fit my use cases. I've been wanting an opportunity to create a simplistic app (in concept, design, styling and code) and I thought creating a to-do list with bootstrap would be a great option. 
My goals included:
* Effective use components, creating components with as much reusability as possible
* Effective use of loops/mapping for rendering
* Simple/sleek (and mobile-friendly) UI using Bootstrap
* Ability to easily integrate in to a PWA

## Roadmap

- [ ] Optimize mobile layout as much as possible
    - [ ] Landscape layout adjusts properly with rotation of phone
    - [ ] Mobile-only buttons/interactions to create easily navigatable/usable user experience
- [ ] Advanced styling (while keeping simple/sleek)
- [ ] PWA integration
